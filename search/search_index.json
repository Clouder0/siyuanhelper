You might need a bit understanding of async/await in python to get things work, but it won't be hard. This quickstart tutorial won't cover much related stuff. So don't worry, let's just start. Initialize Most of the time, you'll only use the following code to generate a Siyuan instance. from siyuanhelper.api import Siyuan import asyncio async def main (): siyuan = Siyuan () asyncio . run ( main ()) Get a Block A frequent demand is to search for some specific blocks.

That is to say, though your modification to a block is instantly done, you can't immediately get its information from Siyuan API due to some caching mechanism I guess. Play with Attributes One of Siyuan Note's most powerful features is the custom attributes. You can easily read and write block attributes with the help of Siyuan Helper. await block . attrs . get ( \"custom-attr1\" ) await block . attrs . set ( \"custom-attr2\" , \"value\" ) Searching for blocks with attribute conditions hasn't been supported so far, but on our todo-list .
